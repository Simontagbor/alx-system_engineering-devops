# üö® Incident Postmortem: Bonsai Bazaar Product Page Redirection - ufw Configuration Issue üö®

## Incident Summary
On Saturday, August 8th, 2023, at 6:00 PM, an incident occurred on the Bonsai Bazaar ecommerce website, causing users to be redirected to incorrect pages when making HTTP GET requests for products. This postmortem outlines the technical analysis of the incident, focusing on the ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) configuration, the circumstances leading to the incident, and the steps taken for resolution.

## Incident Timeline
1. ‚è∞ **Saturday, August 8th, 2023, 6:00 PM:** A pull request was merged into the production environment without undergoing rigorous testing, resulting in the deployment of faulty ufw configuration changes.

2. ‚è∞ **Saturday, August 8th, 2023, 6:05 PM:** Users began reporting redirection issues while attempting to access specific bonsai product URLs, indicating a potential problem with incoming traffic routing.

3. ‚è∞ **Saturday, August 8th, 2023, 6:10 PM:** The technical team was alerted to the incident and initiated an investigation to identify the root cause.

4. ‚è∞ **Saturday, August 8th, 2023, 6:15 PM:** Developer Kwame, who was on-call at the time, identified the misconfigured ufw rules as the primary cause of the redirection issue and promptly resolved the issue.

## Root Causes
1. ‚ùå **Unvalidated Pull Request:** The incident was triggered by a pull request merge that lacked rigorous testing. The ufw configuration changes introduced by the merge were not properly validated for potential conflicts or adverse effects.

2. ‚ùó **Rule Conflict in ufw Configuration:** The faulty ufw configuration contained a rule conflict that led to the incorrect redirection of incoming HTTP traffic, causing users to be redirected to unrelated product pages.

## Mitigation Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Saturday, August 8th, 2023, 6:15 PM:** Developer Kwame, upon identifying the root cause, promptly removed the conflicting ufw rule from the configuration, restoring the proper routing of incoming traffic.

2. üîô **Configuration Rollback:** After resolving the issue, a thorough review of the recent pull request was conducted. Any ufw configuration changes introduced by the pull request were rolled back to their previous state to ensure stability.

## Preventive Measures
1. üß™ **Rigorous Testing:** Implement a strict testing protocol for all changes introduced through pull requests before merging them into the production environment. This includes comprehensive ufw configuration testing to identify potential conflicts and issues.

2. ü§ñ **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated testing tools to validate ufw configurations and rule changes, ensuring early detection of conflicts and misconfigurations.

3. üëÄ **Pull Request Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all pull requests, involving relevant team members to ensure that changes are thoroughly examined and approved before deployment.

4. üìö **Documentation and Training:** Enhance documentation on proper ufw configuration practices and conduct training sessions to educate team members on the importance of careful configuration management.

## Conclusion
The incident on Saturday, August 8th, 2023, resulting in the redirection of users to incorrect product pages on the Bonsai Bazaar ecommerce website, was attributed to a misconfigured ufw rule introduced by an unvalidated pull request. Swift action by Developer Kwame led to the timely resolution of the issue. To prevent similar incidents in the future, a series of preventive measures have been proposed, emphasizing rigorous testing, code reviews, and improved documentation practices. These measures aim to ensure the ongoing stability and reliability of the Bonsai Bazaar website's server infrastructure.
