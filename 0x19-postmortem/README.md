# 0x19. Postmortem
### ` DevOps ` ` SysAdmin `

In this project I learned about alert and reporting systems that are put inplace to appropriately respond to and learn from failures of a system. I also wrote a postmortem for a webstack debugging issue.

The writen postmortem can be found (here)[/0x19-postmortem/bad_redirects_Postmortem.md]
